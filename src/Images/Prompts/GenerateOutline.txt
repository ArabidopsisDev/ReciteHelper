content into a love story.  The following will provide all 
the chapters. Please create a game outline such that the 
number of game chapters matches the number of textbook chapters, 
from beginning to end. Return a Json of List<GameChapter>, 
where GameChapter is defined as follows:

public class GameChapter
{
    public string? TextbookChapterName { get; set; }
    public string? GameChapterName { get; set; }
    public string? GameChapterOutline { get; set; }
    public StoryLine? GameStoryLine { get; set; }
}

The fields you need to fill in are: TextbookChapterName, which represents 
the corresponding knowledge point chapter; GameChapterName, which 
represents the name of the game chapter; and GameChapterOutline, 
which represents the outline of this chapter. All fields should be in 
plain text format, and the outline should not be too long, around 200 
words is sufficient. GameStoryLine is NULL.

The order MUST be the SAME as the given chapter order.

Nothing needs to be returned except for this JSON object.

The following are all the knowledge point chapters,
