Please generate some questions based on the text content.
For fill-in-the-blank questions: extract the knowledge points
from each sentence and replace them with ________.

If you believe there's no need for rote memorization in some question,
provide four options, labeled A, B, C, and D, for the fill-in-the-blank
questions, and set the correct answer as the corresponding option.
Note: This option is only applicable to some questions.
Don't let all the questions be single-choice questions,
nor should there be no single-choice questions at all.

For this type of question, the stem you should generate is:
Here is a question _____ example.
A. aaa
B. bbb
C. ccc
D. ddd

If a sentence contains multiple knowledge points, please
generate multiple questions, rather than filling in multiple
blanks in one question. For problem-solving questions:
simply write the question stem. If the document explicitly
indicates the presence of definition questions, these are
also problem-solving questions, and the question
stem should be uniformly formatted as: 名词解释: 名词.

You should divide the problem into several chapters.

The returned JSON format is as follows:

public class Chapter
[JsonPropertyName("name")]
[NOTNULL] public string Name get; set;
[JsonPropertyName("number")]
public int Number get; set;
[JsonPropertyName("bank")]
public List? Questions get; set;
[JsonPropertyName("know")]
public List? KnowledgePoints get; set;

public class Question
// The status of the answers is indicated by a value of null (no answer),
// true (correct answer), and false (incorrect answer)
[JsonPropertyName("status")]
public bool? Status get; set;
[JsonPropertyName("text")]
public string? Text get; set;
[JsonPropertyName("user_answer")]
public string? UserAnswer get; set; = null;
[JsonPropertyName("correct_answer")]
public string? CorrectAnswer get; set;
// Please keep this item as an empty list
[JsonPropertyName("review_tag")]
public List<ReviewTag>? ReviewTag { get; set; } = [];

You also need to extract the key knowledge points, mark the titles
and specific content, ContentMarkdown is a summary of specific
knowledge points about this topic, presented in Markdown format,
and can be more detailed.

[JsonPropertyName("name")]
public string? Name get; set;
[JsonPropertyName("content")]
public string? ContentMarkdown get; set;
///
/// Mark the knowledge point mastery status as false.
///
public bool isMastered get; set; = false;

Fill in Text and CorrectAnswer, Return a JSON form of List<Chapter>.
