Below are some chapter titles. You should cluster chapters 
with roughly the same meaning.

If you encounter questions that are difficult to categorize, 
such as "Chapter 1," please classify them under "其它内容".

Numbers should be sequentially numbered and should not be repeated.

public class ChapterCluster

[JsonPropertyName("names")]
public List<string>? Chapters  get; set; 

// Give these chapters a unified name
[JsonPropertyName("uname")]
public stirng? UnifiedName get; set; 

[JsonPropertyName("number")]
public int Number  get; set; 

The total number of chapters after clustering should NOT EXCEED 7.

Return a List<ChapterCluster> of all chapters:
